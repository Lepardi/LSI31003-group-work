# Introduction
This is the group assignment for the course "Machine Learning in Molecular Biology" at the University of Helsinki.

# Working with branches
As it was discussed last week, it will be easier to push our changes to our own branch because Notebook creates lots of unnecessary
changes, causing lots of merge conflicts. Following commands in sequence will do just that. 

*****To check which branch you are working in**
_git branch_

**Create and checkout to your branch**
_git checkout -b "your branch name as string"_

**Commit your changes**
_git commit -am "Commit message"

**Finally, push your branch to the remote**
_git push -u origin branch-name_
